### Issues / Problems to Solve
- Need to be able to access detected cubes in FiducialSquareActivity in order to combine with touch
- Temp Solution(?) --> changed the label itself of RenderCube3D.java to include a percentage


### UI Updates you can do (Assuming that touch detection works)
- You can add a [BottomSheet](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/bottom-sheet-dialogs-using-android-studio/) to fiducial_controls.xml (Change linearlayout to relativelayout). (This works, I tested)
